  - What is a bemol?
    
    ~ Bemol is the french word for flat. A flat is a musical symbol that gives the instruction to play a note one semitone lower.
  - In order for the project to work properly the .wav files for the songs are necessary.
  - What have we accomplished since Programming Logic?
    
    ~ the code is the same in terms of structure
    
    ~ for the music player to play the songs
  - What are the future plans?
    
    ~ the same selected song can be put on loop or play only one time depending on what the user wants
    
    ~ managing to skip a song
